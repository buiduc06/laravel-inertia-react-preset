# Inertia React Laravel ui preset ðŸ’œ
Leverage ReactJS as your view layer within Laravel. This is a
 preset to setup [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) within a fresh Laravel installation. By using this, you get front-end scaffolding including authentication. Tailwind is setup as well.
